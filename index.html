    <p>Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I've been a stay at home mom for the past 4 and a half years. I was previously a software tester before I had my miracle baby boy. He had some extra needs, so I stayed home with him. Software Engineering was always my path, even after my extended maternity leave. We noticed some delays, and different behavior in our son, so we had him tested. We found out he was on the Autism Spectrum. Needless to say, I went to work getting him everything he needed, securing services, etc. After a lot of hoop jumping, time, and grace, we got his IEP. He's now thiving at an autism specific pre-school, and I have the time to get back on my path. I feel very blessed that I'm able to take this class with you all. I waited my turn, for sure. I don't want to take this opportunity I've been given lightly. I pray we are all successful, get awesome jobs, and lead better lives as a result of it! See you all soon!</p>

        <p id="pbody">
        When Winter fades and Spring has sprung, 
        the sweetest days have just begun.
        Then at the scorching Summer's end,
        I look for Autumn - my dearest friend"
